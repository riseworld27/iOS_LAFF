<b>Online Ticketing</b>
Tickets and passes are available for online purchase via Festival Genius. 

<b>Box Office</b>
The Main Box Office and Will Call are located outside the Triangle Square Cinemas on the top level of Triangle Square located at Newport Blvd. and Broadway. Small box offices are set up at the various venues that can sell tickets specific to that venue. All Box Offices open a half hour before the first screening of the day at that venue.

<b>Day of show tickets</b>
Tickets are only available online until 2 hours before show time. After that you will need to go straight to the Box Office of the venue where that movie will be showing.

<b>Will Call</b>
Advanced ticket purchases will be available for pickup at our main Will Call tent outside of the Triangle Square Cinemas. Single screening will call tickets will also be available at each venue. Please allow enough time before your screening to pick up your tickets.

<b>Rush Lines</b>
We hold a number of seats in each theater for Pass-Holders so there may be extra seats released just before the screening time. Please check with the Box Office to see if Rush Tickets are available for purchase.

<b>Seats cannot be held</b>
You must be present to take a seat. Seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you are not in your seat at show time your seat may be given to someone in the Rush Line.

<b>Remember your coat</b>
All lines are outdoors so please dress accordingly (hat, sunscreen, coat)! The Festival attracts thousands of people, so don’t be surprised is the lines are long and extend outside the theater.

<b>Filmmaker Q&As</b>
In an effort to make the Festival a more interactive experience we encourage the filmmakers to attend and conduct a Q&A after the film. This is your opportunity to ask them your questions about the making of the film.

<b>Arrive to the theater early</b>
To start the film on time, we must seat many people in a very short timeframe. Allow plenty of time for your transportation, especially on weekend nights.

<b>Children are (sometimes) welcome</b>
Not all Festival films are intended for “all audiences,” and few have MPAA ratings attached – audience discretion is advised. As a general rule, children are encouraged to attend only designated films.

<b>We do not show any previews</b>
Screenings start within five minutes of the scheduled time. However, the festival cannot be held accountable for late starts.

<b>We take movies seriously</b>
Please silence your wrappers, voices, communication devices and alarms to ensure a quality audience experience.

<b>Volunteer Staff</b>
Most of the venues are staffed by volunteers who can answer many of your questions. They help make the festival possible by donating their time so please be patient, and don’t forget to thank them for their efforts.

<b>Festival News</b>
Repeat screenings, events, and guest updates are posted and announced regularly at the Box Office, online on Facebook, Twitter, and our website NewportBeachFilmFest.com
